# Adventure Works Project

### Project Dashboard:
[Adventure Works Analysis](./Power_bi/Dashboard.pdf)

### Summary:

Using SQL Server, Python, Power BI, and Excel, I pulled data from the database, made calculations with DAX in Powerbi, and created a dashboard 


### Business Problem:
We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
We want to focus on the amount we have sold what products to which clients, and how it has been over time.
We measure our numbers against the budget to compare our values against performance. 


### Objective:

Create a comprehensive report to analyze the key metrics (Total sales per product, client segment, quarterly/yearly sales )

A handful of KPIs were provided to analyze the data, but I have created additional KPIs like ARPU (Average Revenue Per User).

### Methodology:

1. SQL query that extracts, cleans, and transforms the data from SQL Server.

2. Build a dashboard in Power BI.

3. Conduct a more detailed  analysis in Python.

### Skills:

### Results & Business Recommendation:

1. Most product sales are Bikes
2. Most Revenues come from High segment customers so we need to focus on these segments in marketing
3. Female buy more than Male
4. The fourth quarter of every year is the best selling quarter so we need to increase marketing in these months
5. We do well in all Months except February, July, September, and December so we need to make a new strategy for these months
